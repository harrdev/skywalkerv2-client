# Outstanding Issues:
    * Died Location for people (both forms) not working, it's being passed to the route, but not saving in the database.  It looks like there aren't any typos?
    * Remove or change popup window confirmation upon form submissions
    * Bug with not being able to save the same object that another user saved
    * Delay in fetching data from DB causing filter.map to be undefined in faveplanetdetail for residents
