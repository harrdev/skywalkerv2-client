# Outstanding Issues:
    * Died Location for Add New Person not working, it's being passed to the route, but not saving in the database.  It looks like there aren't any typos?
    * Remove popup window confirmation upon form submissions
    * Organize file structure
    * Delete exampleApp db name in server db.js
    * Death location not working in people edit
